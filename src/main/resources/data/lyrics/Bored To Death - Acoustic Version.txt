Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
